<h1>Chile is exposed to 7 of the 9 vulnerability</h1> <h4>criteria defined by the UNFCCC.

Chile is exposed to 7 of the 9 vulnerability criteria defined by the UNFCCC. In 2015, we were recognized as one of the 10 countries most vulnerable to the risks of climate change by German Watch; and Rapa Nui was identified as the sixth most vulnerable tourist destination but the effects of climate change are not the same throughout the country – our diverse geography means there are different impacts in different regions. The Central Valley and the Center-South of the country have been experiencing an unprecedented drought for the past 8 years, meanwhile rainfall in the Southern Zone and Great North regions is increasing. Drought and extreme heat have also given rise to the incidence of significant forest fires, which have hit a large part of the Central Valley and have been especially damaging in Valparaíso, Maule, O’Higgins and Biobio. The northern regions of Coquimbo and Atacama – some of the driest places in the world – have experienced incredible rainfall and floods. There was also a major landslide caused by a breaking glacier in the Maule region that devastated an entire town. These are just some examples of impact – if we were to mention all the events, the list would be too long.</h4>
